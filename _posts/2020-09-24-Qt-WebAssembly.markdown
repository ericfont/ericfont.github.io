So happy that [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) and [emscripten](https://emscripten.org) has matured to the point that [Qt](https://qt.io) is easily able to deploy apps to the browser.  They provide several [examples](https://www.qt.io/qt-examples-for-webassembly).  I've followed their [wiki](https://wiki.qt.io/Qt_for_WebAssembly) using Qt 5.15.1 with emsk 2.0.2 and sucessfully compiled their "Hello Window" test to render a 3D opengl object inside a browser...try it out:

[Hellow Window]({% link qt/hellowindow/index.html %})
